# 1. Fundamental Indiactors
Compared to technical analysts, fundamental traders look at various economic indicators and reports to better understand future market directions. Even though most retail traders focus on technical analysis, understanding the fundamentals is always helpful. Especially for swing traders, if we look at the bigger picture and in the longer time horizon, markets are most often moving based on fundamental drivers. There are dozens of different fundamental indicators for different countries and we certainly do not have to know all of them. Here are the most important ones that tend to have an impact on the markets.

## Employment reports

Employment reports include employment change, unemployment rates, number of jobless individuals applying for government support, level of payrolls and other job-related data. The most famous employment report is the US NFP which is normally released on the first Friday of every new month.

## Gross domestic product (GDP)

Changes in the GDP can have a large impact on foreign currency. An increase in GDP tells us that the economy is strengthening, and currency could rise. A decrease in GDP indicates a weakening economy, therefore the possibility of failing prices in the currency.

## Trade balance

Trade balance represents the difference between the imports and exports of the subject economy and affects the demand for that country’s currency. There are two possible outcomes – a deficit, which means the country is importing more than exporting and a surplus which is the opposite.

## Consumer price index (CPI)

The consumer price index tells us prices of products on a consumer level and it is also a key indicator of inflation. Changes in CPI can directly influence monetary policy as it is mandatory for most major central banks to control inflation. An increase in inflation usually indicates an interest rate rise, while lower CPI readings indicate lower interest rates.

## The purchasing managers index (PMI)

The purchasing managers index shows the activity of purchasing managers and can act as a leading economic indicator. PMI indicates strength or weakness in the manufacturing sector.

## Interest rate decisions

Interest rates are part of the central bank’s monetary policy. The leading indicators include activities and speeches by bank officials that are regularly watched by traders.  Interest rate changes by central banks are very important in the valuation of currencies. If banks set high-interest rates, their currency usually attracts foreign assets from countries with lower interest rates.

## Central bank statements

Most central banks issue statements to describe their monetary policy and why they did or did not make any changes. These statements affect the markets, especially if the changes are unexpected. We use the terms hawkish and dovish in the central bank’s decisions. Central banks are hawkish when they want to tighten monetary policy by increasing interest rates or reducing balance sheets. Being hawkish means strong economic growth. Dovish is the opposite when banks reduce interest rates or increase quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. Being dovish means weak economic growth.

# 2. Economic Calander

This lesson will introduce you to the Economic calendar, also known as a macro calendar.
Economic calendar

It’s a calendar covering key global macroeconomic and political upcoming events. Basically, it tells us when key economic events like GDP, inflation, and central bank meetings occur. Macroeconomic news announcements are very often connected with higher volatility in the market. Thus, the macroeconomic calendar gives us a hint of potentional turbulence on the market. Therefore, it should be checked by the trader each day before trading. The economic calendar teaches traders to plan.

For example, if we are waiting for the trend to be changed or technical formation to be broken or finished, it can be just important news which moves the markets in a new direction. For example, according to FSSI, the central bank meeting was the news with the highest average impact of 150 pips on the FX market in 2020. Higher volatility after a news release usually lasts from 30 minutes to 2 hours. The higher volatility related to a news release may look attractive and sometimes creates an illusion of a big potential profit. However, the news release can be connected with big jumps in price, and higher spreads, which could unexpectedly hit stop loss or cause price slippage. Therefore, watching the economic calendar and awareness of key economic events should be part of each money management.

Let’s have a look at how the economic calendar works.

There are a lot of economic calendars available on many websites. It’s up to us which one we prefer to use. Mostly it’s a force of habit for each trader. In this lesson, we will look at the macroeconomic calendar available at forexfactory.com. In the upper left corner, we can see the ordinary workday calendar. At this place, we can select the day or a week of our interest. In the first column, titled date, there is the date when the news is released (in other words, by clicking on the day, we can see which news is released that day and what we can expect).

In the second corner, there is the time of the news release. Clicking on it, we can select our time zone and time format and turn on or turn off daylight saving time. The next column shows the currency impacted by the event. Generally, if the news is related to the eurozone economy, it influences the euro. If its news says something about the U.S. economy, it impacts the USD and so on. The column titled impact is a significant one. It shows the expected impact of the news on the currency. The more important the news, the bigger impact in terms of volatility is expected. Colours distinguish the strength of the expected impact. The news marked by the red factory are those with the highest expected impact on the currency, that is, with the highest volatility. The news marked with the orange factory is expected to have a medium impact on the currency, and the yellow one usually has the lowest impact. Bank holidays are marked white.

The next column tells the name of the news, which is released.

The sixth column, titled detail, offers a detailed description of the news. By clicking on it, we can read more about the news, for example, the source of the data, the frequency of publishing this news, a detailed description of this news explaining its link to the economy and, most importantly, the effect of the news on the currency. Specifically, it says that if the indicator’s released value is higher than the expected value, whether it is positive or negative for the currency.

Finally, the column titled actual provides us with the economic indicator’s latest released value. This value is compared with the forecasted value. The difference between the forecasted value (in the next column) and the actual value is the information markets are interested in, which is the source of volatility. The penultimate column, titled previous, shows the previous value of the indicator. Clicking on the last column, graph, the chart with historical values pops up. We can select a date range in the upper right corner of the chart.

Another useful tool is the filter in the upper right corner. We can customize the calendar and select the news we are interested in; for example, we want to see only the most important news (marked red) or the news coming only from the selected country (let’s say the USA). If we are more metals or energy traders, we should switch the calendar in the navigation panel.


# 3. Risk-on vs Risk-off

Risk on and risk-off are part of fundamental analysis and reflect on the sentiment of traders. What they mean and how we can interpret them in our trading? We will explore that in this lesson.

## Risk-on vs risk-off

Risk-on and risk-off are market sentiments where traders and investors either take or do not take a risk in the financial markets. We can often hear on the news that we are in risk-on or risk-off market conditions. Understanding what this means can help us trade and choose the right instruments to trade.

### Risk-on

When markets are in a risk-on environment, market participants feel optimistic about the economy, so they go long on riskier assets. These are stocks, high-yielding bonds or currencies like AUD, NZD, CAD from majors or NOK, ZAR, TRY from exotics. In commodities risk-on instruments are oil or copper.

### Risk-off

When market participants are pessimistic about the economy or they expect some uncertainty in the market with a negative impact, they shift from risky assets towards so-called safe havens. Typical risk-off assets are US Treasury bonds or German bonds. For forex traders, these are the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc which often time rally during the risk-off sentiment as traders are unwinding carry trades. Carry trade means borrowing a safe-haven asset at a low-interest rate and then buying a high-yielding (riskier) asset in other markets.

Why are the Japanese yen and Swiss franc considered safe-haven currencies? Because they are from countries that own a large amount of foreign currency assets so they can sell those assets and bring to reduce risk. The US dollar is also considered a safe-haven asset. Especially because during risk-off sentiment traders exit their stock and other risky positions back to the US dollar. In a commodity market, gold is considered to be a safe-haven asset.

Here is the recap of instruments and directions we should be choosing during different environments.

### Trading during risk-on

Long – stocks, commodity currencies (AUD, NZD, CAD), exotics, oil

Short – bonds, US dollar, yen, Swiss franc

### Trading during risk-off

Long – US bonds, German bonds, US dollar, yen, Swiss franc, gold

Short – stocks, commodities, non-commodity currencies

### Predicting the risk-on and risk-off

One of the great charts to predict risk appetite are VIX and dollar index.

VIX have a negative correlation with the S&P 500, which means if VIX is up, S&P500 is down.

This means that when VIX is up we look for risk-off sentiment in the market and vice versa.

The dollar index is another great sentiment indicator as it tracks the performance of US dollar against all major currencies. When dollar is going up, we are looking for risk-off sentiment, when the dollar is going down we are looking for a risk-on sentiment. This is simply because all stocks and other risky instruments are cashed out back into the dollar.

# 4. Market Correlations
[video](https://youtu.be/UfL4oI8_aI0)

Understanding market correlations can provide us with an edge in the markets in terms of seeking new opportunities. Besides, knowing what assets are correlated can significantly reduce our exposure as we can diversify and deploy our resources elsewhere. This lesson will cover everything we need to know about market correlations.

## Market correlations

Besides correlations in forex, there are also some interesting correlations in commodities and indices markets. Since FTMO is offering these instruments as well in the form of CFDs, we will cover them in this article. Also, bear in mind that correlations very often break and they are more obvious on larger timeframe horizons. If we are focusing solely on day trading or short term trading, we can see that correlation between different assets is getting stronger and weaker. Correlation should be viewed as a factor of possible confluence, not a be-all and end-all.

### Equity indices and safe-haven assets

This is something we spoke about in our risk-on vs risk-off article. When equities and equity indices go down, fear prevails in the markets. This means that traders and investors move their assets into safe havens such as gold, yen or bonds.

![img3](https://academy.ftmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2021-04-13-at-9.46.12-1024x600.png)

In this case, we are talking about a negative correlation since one asset is going up and the second is going down, often with a high degree of mirroring.

### Canadian dollar and crude oil
Crude oil is very important for the Canadian economy. Because of that, prices of crude and Canadian dollar are positively correlated. In the forex trading world, it means that rising prices in crude oil are equal to falling prices of USDCAD.

![img4](https://academy.ftmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2021-04-16-at-10.56.43.png)

### The Australian dollar and Canadian dollar

Both Australian and Canadian economies are heavily dependent on commodities. Australia is connected with precious metals (iron ore, gold) and Canada with crude oil. Thanks to that, we can see a strong inverse correlation between AUDUSD and USDCAD.

![img5](https://academy.ftmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2021-04-16-at-11.21.25.png)

### Equity indices and AUDUSD

Due to the Australian economy’s dependence on export, there is a positive correlation between AUD and equity indices as they reflect the strength of the world’s economy. If the Australian dollar is rising, we can see a positive correlation with the global economy. The most popular index to watch is the S&P500.

![img](https://academy.ftmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2021-04-16-at-11.47.22-1024x550.png)

### Gold and USDJPY

There is a high negative correlation between gold and USDJPY. If gold goes up, USDJPY usually falls.

![img](https://academy.ftmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2021-04-16-at-13.05.29.png)
This is due to the fact that both gold and Japanese yen are considered safe-haven assets, therefore, when there is a fear in the markets, traders tend to move their capital into gold and Japanese yen.
