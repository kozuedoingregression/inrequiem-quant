# InRequiem Quantative

**Your Chaos, Our Equation**

We are **InRequiem Research** – the quantitative research, trading, and modeling division of the InRequiem ecosystem. Born from late-night experiments, too much coffee, and a deep love of math, we’re a firm that lives at the intersection of code, chaos, and capital.

We don’t just crunch numbers. We weaponize data.

## So, Why Are You Here?

You're probably in one of two positions:

- You’ve got a brilliant idea (or a messy one) and need data-driven minds to bring it to life.
- You’ve hit a wall, and your organization needs our expertise to go through it—or around it—with elegance.

Either way, we got you.

## Our Philosophy: Think First, Code Second

**Listen.** Most people treat markets like they’re math. We treat them like they’re living organisms. Every engagement starts with understanding the underlying behavior—whether it’s a stock ticker or a satellite board.

**Model.** We love the hard problems. Financial time series, noisy signals, unstructured alt-data. We break them down with a mix of econometrics, probability, and machine learning. Clean theory. Dirty data. No shortcuts.

**Build.** Once we’ve nailed the math, we deploy resilient, low-latency systems that actually do what they're supposed to. Think HFT pipelines, alpha engines, custom indicators, live dashboards, and predictive infra.

## What We Actually Do

- Systematic Trading Strategies (equities, crypto, derivatives, synthetic instruments)
- Predictive Modeling (ML + alternative data = alpha)
- Quant Infrastructure (execution systems, backtesting frameworks)
- Portfolio Optimization & Risk Management
- Autonomous Agents (bots that do more than just trade)
- Forecasting + Time Series Analysis (ARIMA to Transformer, you name it)

## Some of Our Work (Redacted... mostly)

We’d love to tell you everything, but NDAs are real. Still, here’s a taste:

- Built a **deep reinforcement learning agent** that outperformed human traders across multiple markets. It wasn’t even trying.
- Created a **custom execution engine** that slices orders like a sushi chef – fast, silent, and precise.
- Modeled global macroeconomic indicators to forecast currency movement using satellite imagery + economic sentiment scraping. Yes, really.
- Deployed **autonomous trade bots** with real-time signal updates from social sentiment and market microstructure data.
- Wrote a **synthetic instrument simulator** for stress-testing strategies under alternate macro scenarios (think 2008 but weirder).

## Tech We Love

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Rust  
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, XGBoost, TensorFlow  
- **Infra:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker, GCP  
- **Backtesting:** Custom-built frameworks  
- **Data Ingestion:** Web scrapers, APIs, NLP pipelines 
- **Trading:** FIX protocol, WebSocket feeds, REST APIs  
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Dashboards, Shiny vibes
